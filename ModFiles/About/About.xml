	<description>Makes chance of pyromaniacs and gourmands having random breaks also dependent on mood.

The description of the Pyromaniac trait claims that fire starting sprees are more likely with lower mood. This is not the case, it is actually just a fixed chance.
This mod changes that chance to be dependent of mood, with the chance gradually increasing decreasing up to 80% mood, where it decreases much more quickly up to 90% mood, and never occurs over that.
Gourmand is affected the same way (although its description does not claim to depend on mood).
